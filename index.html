<!-- There's going to be a float happening for here -->
            <p>I'm Jessica Maria Sulaiman, I'm born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. I'm a graduate of Temple University. I've studied music and video production during my time in college. I transferred from Community College of Philadelphia to Temple University in 2013. Then I graduated in the next two years from Temple.
                <br>
             
                I'm excited about the course I'm taking right now at UPenn. I love to learn and explore topics that are new and interesting to me. My philosophy is that life is a journey and we shouldn't take it too seriously, however, responsibly of course. 
                <br>
                
                I have traveled to some places so far. I've been to Colombia twice since that is the birth place of my parents. (I'm a first generation born in the USA). I've also been to Miami, NYC, California, Las Vegas, Kansas, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey.
                <br>
                Fun fact: I'm a huge Batman fan since the 1990s. Yup, I'm a 90s baby. :D
